## Native C++ UDF's for Apache Impala

Our goal is to create and make available native C++ UDFs for use
on Apache Impala.
Thereby helping to spread this wonderful feature that allows us to solve
problems of all kinds with performance and security.

As much as possible we will provide UDFs for use and learning.

- liblocation: <br>
It is a minimal library of functions related to Geo localization to be used directly in SQL statements in Apache Impala. See liblocatio/READMED.md for details.
