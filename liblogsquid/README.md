## liblogsquid

It's a library of utility functions to manipulate the registration line generated by the Squid-cache proxy.<br>
The main function *squid_logparts()*, allows us to retrieve only the information from the part of the log that interests us in a very simple way.<br>
The motivation to write these routines, in addition to the study and improvement of techniques, was due to the fact that this type of approach frees us from the SERDE routines in Java, usually written for data collection systems such as Apache Flume.<br>
So, very naturally, we can use these functions directly in SQL statements.
